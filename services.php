                        Briefly, we perform any kind of repairs. We specialize in major 
                        renovations (fitting for pants, skirts, blouses, jackets, coats, 
                        raincoats, jeans hamming using the original cut and design) and 
                        minor repairs (replacements of zippers and gap fillings). Damage 
                        removal and control is performed by all the possible means, in our 
                        work, we do our best to make traces of repair completely unnoticeable, 
                        and in the case of fitting for a figure- a perfect fit. Virtually, 
                        there is nothing we cannot do with clothes. In our practice, it is 
                        not uncommon for clients that have been turned down by other studios 
                        to find what they are looking for with us. Among our clients, there 
                        are those who bought their suits in major retailer stores and altered 
                        their clothes at our studio to achieve that perfect fit.

                        Oh, the wedding is approaching and still no dress. No, of course there is plenty 
                        of dresses out there- all different shapes, colors and cuts. But the one you need
                        is nowhere to be found. You've been to more than one bridal salon, and still could 
                        not find the dress of your dreams, in which you can feel like a real bride- a gentle,
                        refined air princes that will leave the groom speechless. Is there something that
                        gets in a way of you finding your perfect dress: maybe it's that salons do not 
                        offer that specific style anymore, or maybe it's that particular figure that does
                        not allow finding a perfect dress? Same thing can happen with a prom dress or any
                        evening gown. Marianna's Alteration offers individual tailoring of wedding, evening 
                        or prom gowns of any complexity taken from catalogs, magazines or client's own designs.
                        Our studio is ready to offer assistance, when a wedding or evening dress does not fit 
                        properly, by offering alterations. We perform alterations of any complexity: from hamming 
                        to size adjustments, fit-fashioned corsets, zipper replacements, etc. Every detail of 
                        your dress should emphasize your best assets and conceal the shortcomings, be comfortable 
                        and stunning at the same time. Executed alterations, and dress fittings performed by our 
                        specialists will add unique charm to your wedding or evening gown.
